# Inspiration for EESSI

The EESSI concept is heavily inspired by software stack provided by the
[Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://alliancecan.ca/en/about/alliance),
for known as *Compute Canada* (see also [here](../cvmfs/flagship-repositories.md)), but is significantly more ambitious by:

* Aiming to support a broader range of system architectures than what is currently supported by the
  Compute Canada software stack;
* Enabling the community


More information on the Compute Canada software stack is available in:

* [their documentation]();
* 

, which is a shared software stack used on all 5 major national systems in Canada and a bunch of smaller ones.

The design of the Compute Canada software stack is discussed in detail in the PEARC'19 paper "Providing a Unified Software Environment for Canadaâ€™s National Advanced Computing Centers"[^2].

It has also been presented at the 5th EasyBuild User Meetings (slides[^3], recorded talk[^4]), and is well documented.
