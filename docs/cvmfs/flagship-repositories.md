# Flagship CernVM-FS repositories

## LHC experiments

CernVM-FS repositories are used to distribute the software required to analyse the data produced by the
[Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) at each of the
[LHC experiments](https://home.cern/science/experiments).

Examples include *(click to browse repository contents)*:

* [`/cvmfs/alice.cern.ch`](https://cvmfs-monitor-frontend.web.cern.ch/browse/alice.cern.ch): software for [ALICE](https://home.cern/science/experiments/alice) experiment
* [`/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch`](https://cvmfs-monitor-frontend.web.cern.ch/browse/atlas.cern.ch): software for [ATLAS](https://home.cern/science/experiments/atlas) experiment
* [`/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch`](https://cvmfs-monitor-frontend.web.cern.ch/browse/cms.cern.ch): software for [CMS](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) experiment
* [`/cvmfs/lhcb.cern.ch`](https://cvmfs-monitor-frontend.web.cern.ch/browse/lhcb.cern.ch): software for [LHCb](https://home.cern/science/experiments/lhcb) experiment
* [`/cvmfs/sft.cern.ch`](https://cvmfs-monitor-frontend.web.cern.ch/browse/sft.cern.ch): LCG Software Stacks

## LCG Releases

The LCG Software Stack which is distributed via the CernVM-FS repository `/cvmfs/sft.cern.ch`
contains over 450 external packages as well as HEP specific tools and generators.

There are usually two releases per year as well as development builds every night.

Software installations included often come with a script that updates your shell environment
for using them by sourcing it. In addition, through so-called *views* a complete software stack
can be made available in your shell environment.

For more information, see <https://ep-dep-sft.web.cern.ch/document/lcg-releases> and
<https://lcgdocs.web.cern.ch/lcgdocs/lcgreleases/introduction>.

## The Alliance

The [Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://alliancecan.ca/en/about/alliance), a.k.a. *The Alliance* and formerly
known as *Compute Canada*, uses CernVM-FS to distribute the software stack for the Canadian national compute clusters.

Documentation on using their CernVM-FS repository `/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca` is available
[here](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Accessing_CVMFS/en), and an overview of available software is available
[here](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Available_software).

## Unpacked containers

CernVM-FS repositories can be used to provide an efficient way to access container images,
by serving unpacked container images that can be consumed by container runtimes such as [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org).

Examples include:

* [`/cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch`](https://cvmfs-monitor-frontend.web.cern.ch/browse/unpacked.cern.ch)
* `/cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org`

More information on `unpacked.cern.ch` is available in the CernVM-FS documentation:

* [Container Images and CernVM-FS](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cpt-containers.html)
* [Working with DUCC and Docker Images](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cpt-ducc.html)

## EESSI

The [*European Environment for Scientific Software Installations (EESSI)*](https://eessi.io) provides optimized installations
of scientific software for `x86_64` (Intel + AMD) and `aarch64` (64-bit Arm) systems that work on any Linux
distribution.

We will use EESSI as an example CernVM-FS repository throughout this tutorial.
